# ESP8266-Deauther

This project is an ESP8266 deauther that can be controlled via the web.  
I assembled the hardware and used open source code from [SpacehuhnTech](https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech).

## Feature
- Deauth : Closes the connection of WiFi devices by sending deauthentication frames to access points and client
					devices you selected.
- Beacon : Beacon packets are used to advertise access points. By continuously sending beacon packets out, it
					will look like you created new WiFi networks.
- Probe : Probe requests are sent by client devices to ask if a known network is nearby.<br>
					Use this attack to confuse WiFi trackers by asking for networks that you specified in the SSID
					list.
